# SAP FI Data Analysis (with Python)

## Overview
This repository contains the code for my capstone project in the SAP-FI-Data-101 course for data professionals. 
The project focuses on exploring and analyzing data from the BSEG and BKPF tables in SAP FI using Python as well as some financial and statistical analysis. 
**[The free video course SAP-FI-DATA-101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3F_r6VMZfU&list=PLYSheVN0dF4PVqgjc0cyGCVEPhJUe_isk)** explains the information stored in these tables as well as foundation knowledge of financial accounting fundamentals and SAP ERP, while the capstone project demonstrates the practical application of this knowledge through statistical and financial analysis.
